I've been wanting to try <ExternalLink url="https://odin-lang.org/" label="Odin" /> for a while now and decided I'd try it out for this year's Advent of Code event. Rather than going blindly into that, though, I thought it best to get some practice in first, so I started tackling the 2016 AoC event instead.

To that end, I put together some useful utils and VS Code configurations to make working on AoC puzzles in Odin a little easier.

TODO: write the rest!

If you'd like to use the template, here's the repository:

<OpenGraphSummary url="https://github.com/Riari/odin-aoc-vscode-template" />

<Alert type="info">
For those unfamiliar, <ExternalLink url="https://adventofcode.com/" label="Advent of Code" /> is a Christmas-themed annual event consisting of an advent calendar of programming puzzles. Each day, from the 1st of December to the 25th (inclusive), a puzzle is unlocked. Each puzzle takes the form of a fictional scenario requiring two answers. Input values are generated per user, so you have to solve the puzzles with your own input to discover your uniquely correct answers. Completing a part earns you one star, with 50 possible stars to obtain per event.

There are public leaderboards as well as the option to create private ones for those who wish to compete against their chosen peers.

It's an excellent way to explore a language you've not used before or practice in one you're already familiar with!
