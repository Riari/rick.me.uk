Unreal Engine ships with some powerful features for profiling CPU, GPU, and memory performance. In Unreal Engine 5, they're delivered by Unreal Insights, a suite of tools for capturing performance data at runtime and analysing it. It takes the place of the older Unreal Profiler available in UE 4 and deprecated in 5.0.

In this post, I'll walk through the basics of profiling via Unreal Insights (with an emphasis on measuring the CPU performance of custom C++ code) as well as how to set up two third-party C++ profilers - <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy">Tracy</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/bombomby/optick">Optick</ExternalLink>.

Everything I demonstrate in this post is based on Unreal Engine 5.4.4, but should apply to any `5.*` version. Also note that I won't go into detail with respect to profiler result analysis and code optimisation as these are both deep topics that warrant posts of their own. Regardless, I hope you find this useful!

### Unreal Insights

Unreal Insights consists of two executables:

* **UnrealTraceServer**: the backend. The server is responsible for recording high volumes of performance data (categorised by _Channels_) from the engine.
* **UnrealInsights**: the frontend. This includes the Session Browser GUI for opening and analysing traces stored by the trace server.

Before you begin tracing, you can select the trace channels you're interested in via the Trace menu in the bottom right of the editor:

<Image src={insightsSelectChannelsImage} alt="Trace menu - channel selection" style="max-height: 500px;"></Image>

Note that the defaults are sufficient for common profiling tasks.

#### Starting a trace session

There are two ways of starting a trace session:

1) Via the Trace menu, which allows you to profile your game while it's running in the editor viewport.
2) By starting your game in standalone mode with the Session Browser window open.

The latter method is preferable since it means your game is running independently of the editor, eliminating some of the overhead associated with running it inside the editor and giving you a more accurate picture of performance - not to mention it does away with the need to manually start and stop traces.

To do this, first make sure your play mode is set to Standalone Game:

<Image src={setStandaloneModeImage} alt="Setting play mode to Standalone Game"></Image>

Then open up the Session Browser window via the Trace menu:

<Image src={openSessionBrowserImage} alt="Opening the session browser via the Trace menu in the lower right of the editor"></Image>

As long as you keep that window open, the editor should automatically start tracing every time you start the game. Closing the game window will similarly terminate the trace session.

<Alert type="tip">
The trace server should automatically start when you launch Unreal Editor. If it's not running, traces will fail to start.

If attempting to start the server via the Trace menu doesn't work (which was the case for me when I last tried this on a new UE 5.5 project), you can start it manually. On Windows, you can find the binary at `Engine\Binaries\Win64\UnrealTraceServer.exe` under your Unreal Engine installation directory. You can start it as a background process by executing `UnrealTraceServer.exe fork`.

The command may result in the error "Error: Deamon is configured to run in sponsored mode, but no sponsor pid has been specified.". When the server runs in sponsor mode, it'll only run as long as any local processes are using it, then it'll shut down. You can disable sponsored mode by modifying the `settings.ini` file specified in the output (by default, this should be `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\UnrealEngine\Common\UnrealTrace\settings.ini`) to specify `Sponsored=0`. The server should then start successfully with `UnrealTraceServer.exe fork`.

When you're done using the trace server, you can kill it with `UnrealTraceServer.exe kill`.
</Alert>

The Trace Store tab in the Session Browser lists all of the traces stored on the server, including live ones (denoted with "LIVE" in the status column). Double-clicking a trace will open it, presenting you with a frame time graph, a flame graph of timer events, a table of timers and their performance stats, and a few other views:

#### Timing custom C++ code

The engine provides a range of macros for instrumenting your code with trace events. There are different types of event covering CPU timing, counters, memory allocations and more, and it's possible to define custom event types so you can implement more specialised tracing behaviour depending on your exact needs.

For this example, I'll use one of the built-in scoped timer macros defined in <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/40eea367040d50aadd9f030ed5909fc890c159c2/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/ProfilingDebugging/CpuProfilerTrace.h#L335-L347">Source/Runtime/Core/Public/ProfilingDebugging/CpuProfilerTrace.h</ExternalLink>, `TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE_STR`. This timer starts measuring at the point the macro is called and automatically stops measuring via the RAII mechanism in C++. Its usage looks like this:

```cpp
{
    TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE_STR("My event")
    // Code here is timed
} // The timer stops when exiting scope here
```

To demonstrate this, I'll create some artificial spikes in frame time in one of my projects, which has an enemy actor type that seeks and attacks the player. I'll insert a sleep duration of 30ms in its `InflictWeaponDamageOnTarget` and time it like so:

```cpp
{
    TRACE_CPUPROFILER_EVENT_SCOPE_STR("EnemyActor: Expensive work");
    FPlatformProcess::Sleep(0.03f);
}
```

Obviously this isn't a realistic example of an expensive workload, but it serves the purpose of making frames stand out in the trace results.

After around 25s of gameplay, here are the results:

This type of timer is one of the most commonly used features of C++ profilers, which all have similar macros.

### Alternative profilers

Unreal Engine exposes `FExternalProfiler`, an interface for external profiler integration. See <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/5.4/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/ProfilingDebugging/ExternalProfiler.h">Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/ProfilingDebugging/ExternalProfiler.h</ExternalLink>.

I'll possibly write a guide for integrating profilers with this API at a later date. For now, I'll cover setting up Tracy and Optick with existing integrations.

#### Tracy

<OpenGraphSummary url="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy"></OpenGraphSummary>

<ExternalLink url="https://github.com/Nesquick0/TracyUnrealPlugin">Nesquick0/TracyUnrealPlugin</ExternalLink> provides a solid starting point for a plugin that provides a Tracy implementation. At the time of writing, it's compatible with Tracy 0.9.1 (with some modifications) and current versions of Unreal Engine 5. Installation is detailed in the readme, but in short:

1. Copy the `Tracy` directory from the repo into the `Plugins` subdirectory of your project (create the subdirectory if it doesn't already exist)
2. From a copy of Tracy 0.9.1 source (downloadable <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/archive/refs/tags/v0.9.1.zip">here</ExternalLink>), copy the `public` directory to `Plugins\Tracy\Source\TracyLib`
3. Modify `Plugins\Tracy\Source\TracyLib\public\client\TracyProfiler.cpp` as follows:

```diff
-   ptr += sprintf( ptr, "OS: Windows %i.%i.%i\n", ver.dwMajorVersion, ver.dwMinorVersion, ver.dwBuildNumber );
+   ptr += sprintf( ptr, "OS: Windows %i.%i.%i\n", (int)ver.dwMajorVersion, (int)ver.dwMinorVersion, (int)ver.dwBuildNumber );
```

<Alert type="warn">
In addition to modifying TracyProfiler.cpp, you'll also need to modify the plugin's `FExternalProfiler` implementation to make it compatible:

`Plugins\Tracy\Source\Tracy\Public\TracyPlugin.h`:
```diff
-   virtual void StartScopedEvent(const TCHAR* Text) override;
+   virtual void StartScopedEvent(const FColor& color, const TCHAR* Text) override;
```

`Plugins\Tracy\Source\Tracy\Private\TracyPlugin.cpp`:
```diff
-void FTracyExternalProfiler::StartScopedEvent(const TCHAR* Text)
+void FTracyExternalProfiler::StartScopedEvent(const struct FColor& Color, const TCHAR* Text)
```
</Alert>

At this point, Tracy.exe should be able to connect to the editor or your game as long as they're launched with the `-tracy` command line argument. To set this argument for the game in Standalone Game mode, edit the advanced play mode settings and add `-tracy` to the "Additional Launch Parameters" setting:

<Image src={setLaunchArgsImage} alt="Setting the -tracy argument for Standalone Game mode" caption="Advanced settings for play modes"></Image>

<Image src={tracyProfilerResultsImage} alt="Tracy profiler results captured from one of my projects" caption="Tracy profiler results captured from one of my projects"></Image>

#### Optick

<OpenGraphSummary url="https://github.com/bombomby/optick"></OpenGraphSummary>

Optick's author maintains an Unreal Engine plugin for Optick support. It's <ExternalLink url="https://www.fab.com/listings/1691bfe6-25bd-46cd-973b-7fc9ddde3592">available on Fab</ExternalLink>. At the time of writing, the latest engine version it supports is 5.0.

After adding the plugin to your library, you can find it in the Epic Games Launcher under **Library > Fab Library** and install it to a compatible engine installation.

With the plugin installed, enable it in the editor by going to **Edit > Plugins > Installed > Performance**, enabling the plugin, and restarting the editor. You can then open Optick via **Tools > Open Optick Profiler**.

<Alert type="warn">
As noted in the <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/bombomby/optick/wiki/UE5-Optick-Plugin">plugin documentation</ExternalLink>, Optick uses <ExternalLink url="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-">Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)</ExternalLink> to capture kernel-level events. If you need to do that, you'll need to launch the editor (or your game) with administrator priveleges.

### Closing remarks

While profilers give you the means to dissect frames and really understand what's happening, it's worth noting that the editor also exposes _stat commands_, which in most cases should be checked as a first resort as they can give you immediate insight into potential issues. The most useful of these is arguably `stat unit`, which displays a selection of real-time stats including frame time, draw call count, and the number of primitives being drawn. `stat fps` is similarly useful for observing framerate performance. You can execute these in the console (opened with the <code>`</code> (tilde) key) when running your game via the editor.

You can find a full list of stat commands in <ExternalLink url="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/stat-commands-in-unreal-engine">the documentation</ExternalLink>.

That being said, profilers are powerful tools that, when used effectively, can help you avoid wasting time on red herrings. If you have performance issues and you're unsure of the root cause based on some superficial investigation, you should definitely take advantage of a profiler. I hope this post has been useful to that end!
