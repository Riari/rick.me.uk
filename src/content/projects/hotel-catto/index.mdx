Hotel Catto is a light-hearted simulation game about building the ultimate cat tree and filling it with goodies to attract cats.

I developed it in a week using Godot as a solo participant in the 73rd <ExternalLink url="https://godotwildjam.com/">Godot Wild Jam</ExternalLink>, where it achieved an overall rank of sixth place out of 152 submissions.

Features I implemented for this title include:

* An item interaction/activity system
* A 'needs' system for the cats, encouraging them to use certain items based on their needs
* A custom-designed user interface
* A tutorial system
* An achievement system
* Random profile generation for each cat
* Meows and purrs performed professionally by my cats

You can <ExternalLink url="https://riari89.itch.io/hotel-catto">play it in the browser on itch.io</ExternalLink>.
