I built this website for the Rotary Club of Stamford Burghley in 2009 to facilitate online entries to their annual Santa Fun Run event.

I originally designed and developed it from scratch on top of a Content Management System (CMS) I wrote in PHP as a university project. I migrated it to Laravel in 2014 and have kept it up-to-date ever since.

It currently runs on Laravel 11. Feature highlights include:

* A custom multi-page event entry flow implementing Vue.js for dynamic elements
* PayPal and Stripe integrations for entry payments
* An admin control panel built with the <ExtLink url="https://filamentphp.com/">Filament UI framework</ExtLink>, enabling event organisers to open or close the event, manage users, manage entrants and teams, and edit content
* A data-driven permission system built on Laravel's Authorization system
* An account management frontend for users to manage their address information, entries, teams, and other account details
* Transactional email delivery with <ExtLink url="https://postmarkapp.com/">Postmark</ExtLink> integration
* A custom, fully responsive design

The event is now organised by the <ExtLink url="https://www.stamfordstriders.org/">Stamford Striders running club</ExtLink> and I work with them to deliver new features, fixes and improvements to the website year-on-year.
