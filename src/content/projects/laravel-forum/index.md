Laravel Forum is a lean forum package for modern Laravel. I originally forked it from [github.com/atrakeur/laravel-forum](https://github.com/atrakeur/laravel-forum) to make some small improvements for my own needs, but I found myself getting carried away with it and ended up publishing it as a separate package.

It has since been through a few rewrites and I try to maintain it just enough to keep pace with major Laravel releases. Occasionally I add new features (or accept feature contributions), but the intention is to provide more of a forum framework than a complete product and avoid making it too opinionated, so by design it's less feature-rich than bigger alternatives like [Flarum](https://flarum.org/).
