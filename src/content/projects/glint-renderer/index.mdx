Glint is my second attempt at writing an OpenGL renderer in C++. I built it while following the Udemy course _[Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/)_, developing a rudimentary JSON-based asset system along the way.

It uses [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) for model and material import and supports basic [Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bui_Tuong_Phong) lighting as well as shadowmapping.
