Glint is my second attempt at writing an OpenGL renderer in C++. I built it while following the Udemy course _<ExternalLink url="https://www.udemy.com/course/graphics-with-modern-opengl/">Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++</ExternalLink>_, developing a rudimentary JSON-based asset system along the way.

It uses <ExternalLink url="https://github.com/assimp/assimp">assimp</ExternalLink> for model and material import and supports basic <ExternalLink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bui_Tuong_Phong">Phong</ExternalLink> lighting as well as shadowmapping.
