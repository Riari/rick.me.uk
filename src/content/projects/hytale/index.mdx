Hytale is a sandbox game that was previously under development at Hypixel Studios, where I worked as a software engineer. In 2025, after a long development timeline, the project was cancelled and Hypixel Studios was closed.

Just five months later, in November 2025, the original founders of Hypixel Studios successfully closed a deal with Riot to re-acquire the project in order to finally deliver it to fans around the world through early access.

During my eight years with the original studio, I worked on many aspects of the game across both its original C# client and Java server as well as its newer C++ engine developed using <ExternalLink url="https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/">Flecs</ExternalLink> as its architectural backbone.

You can read more about the game on the <ExternalLink url="https://www.hytale.com/">official website</ExternalLink>.
