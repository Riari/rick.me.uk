Hytale is a sandbox game under development at <ExternalLink url="https://hypixelstudios.com/">Hypixel Studios</ExternalLink>, where I'm currently employed as a software engineer. During my time in this role, I've worked on various aspects of the game, including the technology that drives Hytale's NPC behaviours, gameplay systems, and UI.

It's built on a proprietery voxel engine developed in-house using <ExternalLink url="https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/">Flecs</ExternalLink>, a C/C++ ECS library. If you'd like to read more about the tech, you can find links to the official technical posts below.
