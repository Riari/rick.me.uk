Hytale is a sandbox game under development at <ExternalLink url="https://hypixelstudios.com/" label="Hypixel Studios" />, where I'm currently employed as a software engineer working primarily on the technology we use to create and drive NPCs in the game. You can read more about the game on the <ExternalLink url="https://hytale.com/news" label="official blog" />.

It's built on a proprietery voxel engine developed in-house using <ExternalLink url="https://www.flecs.dev/flecs/" label="Flecs" />, a C/C++ ECS library. If you'd like to read more about the tech, you can find links to the official technical posts below.
