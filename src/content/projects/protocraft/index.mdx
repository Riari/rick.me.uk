Protocraft is a multiplayer RPG I started developing in February 2026 using Unreal. It's primarily an exercise in designing and implementing the kind of gameplay mechanics typically seen in survival crafting games.

This project uses the <ExternalLink url="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/gameplay-ability-system-for-unreal-engine"><b>Gameplay Ability System</b> (GAS)</ExternalLink>. It implements server-authoritative gameplay features using GAS to power gameplay attributes, effects, and abilities.

To read more about GAS, see my <a href="/posts/2024/12/unreal-engine-gameplay-ability-system/">2024 write-up</a>.

Current features include:

* Health and stamina attributes with passive and active effects
* Droppable loot
* Equippable items that can grant primary and secondary abilities
* Basic PvP
* Mineable resource nodes
* HUD with health bar, stamina bar, and hotbar
