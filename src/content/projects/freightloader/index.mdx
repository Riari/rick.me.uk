Freightloader was my entry to <ExternalLink url="https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-59">Godot Wild Jam #59</ExternalLink>, for which the theme was "Train". Although this jam (which takes place every month) lasts nine days, I developed the game in about three days after having a late change of mind from my original idea.

It's a top-down physics game where the aim is to drop crates into moving freight trains according to their colour. I developed it in <ExternalLink url="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</ExternalLink> (as per the rules of Godot Wild Jam!) with GDScript. You can <ExternalLink url="https://riari89.itch.io/freightloader">play it in the browser on itch.io</ExternalLink>.
