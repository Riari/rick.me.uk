I started developing this ARPG demo in Unreal 5 in late 2024. It's an active project that I revisit from time to time with some long-term ideas and goals.

My main goal with this is to learn more about what goes into a satisfying ARPG on a technical level. Diablo 2 was one of my most memorable childhood games, so it seemed inevitable that I would explore something like this eventually!

Currently, it consists of a dungeon level, a player character, a mob type with rudimentary AI, movement and melee animations, player health, HUD, combat and ambient sound effects, and occlusion masking.

You can find the source code (as well as a roadmap with systems and features I'm interested in adding) at <ExtLink url="https://github.com/Riari/unreal-arpg">Riari/unreal-arpg</ExtLink>.

Here's how it looks in action:
