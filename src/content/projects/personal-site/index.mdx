Originally built with <ExtLink url="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</ExtLink>, I rebuilt my personal site with <ExtLink url="https://astro.build/">Astro</ExtLink> in 2024. I've built many other websites for myself over the years, but this one has lasted the longest as I've gradually expanded it from a single page with some basic details about myself to the version you see now with posts and examples of my work.

In 2026, I gave the site a full redesign in a fresh Astro project. It has a completely custom responsive design, content written in a blend of Markdown and <ExtLink url="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</ExtLink>, and styles written in <ExtLink url="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</ExtLink>.
