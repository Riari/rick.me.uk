Originally built with <ExternalLink url="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</ExternalLink>, I rebuilt my personal site with <ExternalLink url="https://astro.build/">Astro</ExternalLink> in 2024. I've built many other websites for myself over the years, but this one has lasted the longest as I've gradually expanded it from a single page with some basic details about myself to the version you see now with posts and examples of my work.

It has a completely custom responsive design with a colour palette based on the popular _Palenight_ syntax theme, content written in a blend of Markdown and <ExternalLink url="https://mdxjs.com/">MDX</ExternalLink>, and styles written in <ExternalLink url="https://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</ExternalLink>.
