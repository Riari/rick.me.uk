        <strong>About me</strong>

        <p>
            I'm Rick, a UK-based developer whose professional experience began
            with full-stack web development in the late 2000s. I grew up in a
            household of nerds, which exposed me to computers, consoles, and
            games from a very early age. I was always curious about how game
            development works and eventually found my way into the games
            industry in 2019, where I currently work as a full time software
            engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since 2019, I've spent much of my leisure time learning more about
            all facets of game development as well as programming in general. I
            occasionally post about those topics here.
