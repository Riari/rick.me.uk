        <strong>About me</strong>

        <p>I'm Rick, a UK-based developer whose professional experience began with full-stack web development in the late 2000s. I grew up in a household of nerds, which exposed me to computers, consoles, and games from a very early age. I was always curious about how game development works and eventually found my way into the games industry in 2019, where I currently work as a full time software engineer.</p>

        <p>Since 2019, I've spent much of my leisure time learning more about all facets of game development as well as programming in general. I occasionally post about those topics here.</p>
